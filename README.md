### :call_me_hand: When I am not working at [Trebellar](https://trebellar.com/), where we help companies and individuals save money and reduce their carbon footprint, I enjoy writing free software, particularly in the area of security tools.

:alien: In previous roles, I have worked as a VoIP programmer, systems administrator and penetration tester.

:cloud: I have fond memories of certain stages in my career. At [Quobis](https://www.quobis.com/), a company I cherish, I transitioned from a system engineer to developer. Later, I had my first startup experience with [Filterly](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/filterly/), where I worked with the entire stack and learned to write proficient JavaScript. A couple of years later, I joined [Feeld](https://www.feeld.co/), where the startup party continued and gained experience handling high volumes of requests. In recent years, I have been assisting scientists at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) in bringing their lab latest inventions to the market.

:pencil: I used to participate in conferences and workshops as a speaker, particularly in the areas of information security and software development (such as ([JSDayES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trvK-DDfF0), [Codemotion](https://madrid2018.codemotionworld.com/speaker/4581/) and [Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-14/arsenal.html#bluebox-ng)). Additionally, I did a bit of [blogging](https://nicerosniunos.blogspot.com/) and have collaborated with sites like [Security By Default](http://www.securitybydefault.com/search?q=Art%C3%ADculo+cortes%C3%ADa+de+Jes%C3%BAs+P%C3%A9rez), [webrtcH4cKS](https://webrtchacks.com/webrtc-hybrid-applications), and [Flu Project](http://nicerosniunos.blogspot.com/2011/11/links-to.html). The links to all the presentations, workshop materials, and articles are available on my [LinkedIn profile](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jesusprubio) profile under "Publications."
