### :call_me_hand: When I’m not busy helping the scientists at [IBM Research](https://medium.com/@IBMResearch) to bring into the world the latest inventions of our labs I like to write free software, specially insecurity tools

:alien: In other lives, I worked as a VoIP programmer, a systems administrator, and even pentester.

:cloud: In particular, I have very good memories of some stages. At [Quobis](https://www.quobis.com), a company from home that I love, I pivoted from system engineer to developer. Later, with [Filterly](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/filterly), appeared my first startup adventure. Playing with the whole stack by necessity and a time to learn to write JavaScript *as the best*. A couple of years after that I ended up at [Feeld](https://www.feeld.co). More startup world party, tons of requests per minute and almost the same lessons learned.

📦 You can check some of my open source work at [GitHub](https://github.com/jesusprubio). We could define myself as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) enthusiast and a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) wannabe.

:speaker: I often participate as a speaker in conferences and workshops at events related to information security and software development ([JSDayES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trvK-DDfF0), [Codemotion](https://madrid2018.codemotionworld.com/speaker/4581/), [Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-14/arsenal.html#bluebox-ng) …).

:pencil: Years ago I had [a blog](http://nicerosniunos.blogspot.com) and I used to collaborate with sites like [Security By Default](http://www.securitybydefault.com/search?q=Art%C3%ADculo+cortes%C3%ADa+de+Jes%C3%BAs+P%C3%A9rez), [webrtcH4cKS](https://webrtchacks.com/webrtc-hybrid-applications) or [Flu Project](http://nicerosniunos.blogspot.com/2011/11/links-to.html). All the presentations, workshop materials, and articles are organized in my [Linkedin profile](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jesusprubio) (under *Publications*).

:call_me_hand: If you want to contribute to any of these activities you can [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesusprubio) or drop some coins [here](https://gist.github.com/jesusprubio/0c7f664d7998dc987c28673117781d57).

PS: Almost forgot! We recently started [this platform](https://freestylestats.com). It’s a pet project for now, but we have very good hopes. We’ll see how it finishes this time …
